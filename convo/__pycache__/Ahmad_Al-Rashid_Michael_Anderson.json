      "message": "Hey Ahmad! Sure, I can do that. I’ll coordinate with Data Science to nail down the requirements. I'm getting some resistance from the data engineers about the new pipeline architecture. They’re worried about the scale of integration issues that might arise. I’ll address that in our next workshop."
