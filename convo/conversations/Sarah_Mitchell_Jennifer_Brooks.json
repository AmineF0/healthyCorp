      "message": "Hey Sarah, it‚Äôs been a busy morning. We've actually noticed some inconsistencies in the API Gateway health metrics too. The response times are jumping up to 3 seconds sporadically. I suspect it‚Äôs linked to the database indexing. Have you tried optimizing the queries further?"

Honestly, getting those unit tests through for Logging System is turning out to be a nightmare. How's your effort on the Backup Verification schedule coming along?"

I might have to use some ‚Äòincentives‚Äô to speed things along. üòè I think if I can show a direct impact on our system performance through some metrics from the ETL logs, it might help my case. Do you have access to the API Gateway logs? They could support this."
