      "name": "Jennifer Brooks",
      "message": "Hey Khalid! Good to hear you're diving into the DR performance. The backup solution is okay, but I've noted a few hiccups during the last verification schedule. We might need to think about scheduling more frequent checks. Got a minute to sync up later?"

      "message": "Yeah, we rolled out a couple last week, but I'm still monitoring API Gateway health closely since we saw some spikes in latency. If you've got time this afternoon, I can walk you through the patch schedule and we can figure out any overlap."
