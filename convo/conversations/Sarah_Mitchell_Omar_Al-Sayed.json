We could downsize some of the heavy nested transformations. Do you want to consider breaking down the log parsing into smaller chunks or implementing a more efficient streaming approach?"

But let‚Äôs be real, the ETL pipeline has been bearing the brunt of the performance headaches. When do you plan to finalize that analysis on system health? I‚Äôd hate to keep kicking this can down the road."

I‚Äôm working on some test cases for logging that should improve our monitoring insights. Might take a few more hours to do it right though!
