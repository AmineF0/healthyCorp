We need to finalize the architecture that's scalable and integrates well with the Microservices Migration we're planning. Any thoughts on potential bottlenecks we should address?"

      "message": "Hi Michael, good morning! I did have a decent weekend, thanks. Regarding the Data Pipeline, I'm concerned about the increased load during peak hours. We might need to review our current Production performance metrics. Do you have specific latencies you’re observing from the last implementation?"

It’d also be worth looking into the Security Alert resolutions we've had recently—might be affecting our load capabilities. Let’s sync up later this week to align on the findings."
