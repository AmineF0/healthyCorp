      "message": "Hi Mariam, yes, I did spend some time on that. I've noticed latency spikes, especially during heavy JSON aggregation‚Äîapproximately 2.3s during the last batch. We might need to optimize the processing framework architecture to address this. Did you get the related metrics?"

      "message": "I did! So cool how you're always diving into the numbers. üòâ I have the metrics from the last two weeks, and they suggest we‚Äôre hitting those spikes about 60% of the time during peak loads. If we tweak the nested loops in the transformation layer, it might improve efficiency. What do you think?"

One thing I‚Äôve noticed is that while the processing engine's reliability is improving, we still need to enhance system monitoring functionalities. It seems to be contributing to some of the backend issues."
