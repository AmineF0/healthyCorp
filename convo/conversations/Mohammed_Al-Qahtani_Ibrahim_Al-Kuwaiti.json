      "message": "Sure! So far, I've pinpointed latency spikes of about 3 seconds during peak loads specifically in the integration layer when processing complex queries. Itâ€™s likely linked to memory pressure. If we patch that through resource management enhancements, that could give us a smoother experience."

Our last workshop shed light on some delaysâ€”maybe transitioning to a more microservices-oriented setup would help. I can share some insights and prepare a document ahead of our next meeting."
