      "name": "Robert Stevens",
      "message": "Morning Mohammed. Yeah, I'm fine. But honestly, the Deep Learning model codebase is a mess. I've been knee-deep in refactoring the Backend Services code. It's taking way longer than I thought because of those damned memory leaks in the Storage Layer. Not to mention, the system latency is killing us."

      "name": "Mohammed Al-Qahtani",

      "name": "Robert Stevens",
      "message": "Definitely! I mean, if I can fix the API services integration issues soon, itâ€™ll make the model training way smoother. But I just can't seem to pinpoint the race conditions in the Cache System. It's a nightmare, trying to pinpoint what's causing that Async overhead."

I have to wonder if we should've opted for a microservices architecture instead of this monolithic nightmare."
