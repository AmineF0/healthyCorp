I also received a few alerts on security parameters being triggered during the last maintenance cycle. Might be worth coordinating on those tasks since they seem interrelated. Whatâ€™s the status on your API endpoints? Are they handling the load adequately?"

If the Query Layer fails, itâ€™s impacting our Processing Engine reliability. If itâ€™s not resolved soon, we may need to rethink the architecture pattern to avoid those bottlenecks. Have you coordinated with the backup team yet?"
