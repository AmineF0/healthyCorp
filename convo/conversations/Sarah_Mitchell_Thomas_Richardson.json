      "message": "Hi Sarah, great to hear about the ETL improvements! I‚Äôve been struggling with query execution efficiency over here‚Äîlatency is still around 2.8 seconds during peak loads. Let‚Äôs discuss the logging integration after I run some tests on memory management."

      "name": "Sarah Mitchell",
      "message": "Sure, but could you confirm that those spikes aren't related to data flow issues? I mean, it's only consistent when the server hits 80% CPU, right? We wouldn't want to introduce logging that slows things down further."
