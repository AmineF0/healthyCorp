I’ve noticed some discrepancies in the data quality reports that we need to address before the sprint planning next week."

      "message": "It seems like our ingestion workflows are getting bottlenecked. I’m pulling some log data for the data validation step, and I suspect it connects to the model training issues we’ve been having. Do you have insights into the API Layer performance metrics? Maybe we should consider mocking the response data for more accurate results?"
