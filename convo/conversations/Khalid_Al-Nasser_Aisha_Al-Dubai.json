It’s tied to our cloud migration timelines and could drag us back if we push the cluster upgrade. Can we analyze the current utilization metrics to see if that upgrade is really necessary?"

Perhaps we could discuss developing new guidelines today during our sync-up? Also, I'd suggest we add more logging to capture these patterns."
