      "timestamp": "2023-10-20T09:20:47Z",
      "name": "Jennifer Brooks",
      "message": "Exactly, it's been tricky. I'm observing backup windows extending beyond expected limits, mainly due to high processing loads. The Monitoring System documentation needs an update too to reflect these changes. Could you check if the query layer adjustments might help optimize this?"

      "timestamp": "2023-10-20T09:23:00Z",
      "name": "Ibrahim Al-Kuwaiti",
      "message": "Sure, let me look into that. I've been optimizing the query layer for performance to tackle similar issues. I'm currently implementing some enhancements to error handling that should help with query reliability. Would you like to catch up later to discuss our findings?"

      "timestamp": "2023-10-20T09:30:10Z",
      "name": "Jennifer Brooks",
      "message": "I did! Iâ€™m a bit cautious about relying too much on automation without understanding the entire workflow. It could impact our backup solutions if not aligned properly. What do you think?"
